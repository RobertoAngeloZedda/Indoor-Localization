# Indoor-Localization

This project aims to solve a [Machine Learning Challenge](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/MLC2018/) which consists in a Indoor Localization task using CNNs.

The problem has been interpreted as a classification task.

The dataset is available [here](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/EgocentricShoppingCartLocalization/).
